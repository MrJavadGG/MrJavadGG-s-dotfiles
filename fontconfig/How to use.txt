After installing "vazirmatn-fonts" pkg via an AUR-helper like 'yay' or 'paru' (or even building it manually after cloning https://aur.archlinux.org/vazirmatn-fonts.git), put this folder into your ".config" folder in "home" directory to make the persian texts look like better. 
Example:
~/home/MrJavadG/.config/
